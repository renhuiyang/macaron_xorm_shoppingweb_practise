					 <h5><b>21/6/2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Mengdi Liu &nbsp;&nbsp; Christchurch, New Zealand</b></h5>
                     <h5>"Laborelief was helpful to help me going 
through contractions. Having a natural labour without epidural (1st 
baby) - this only happened because it was too late to take it. I 
absolutely relied on Laborelief to help me deliver the baby in a few 
pushes as baby was getting tired and they had to deliver him ASAP. It 
gave me the confidence that I would be able to push the baby out. Thank 
you!!"</h5>
                     <br>
					 <h5><b>13/1/2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa Compell &nbsp;&nbsp; Sydney, Australia</b></h5>
                     <h5>"My pain relief was removed for second stage of
 labour so the Laborelief gave me something to focus on and it felt like
 I still had something to help me through it"</h5>  
                     <br>
					 <h5><b>01/03/2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Norman Bling &nbsp;&nbsp; Washington D.C, USA</b></h5>
                     <h5>“I found it excellent for the pushing stage.<br>
Made me calmer and focused. I didn’t need stitches like I had in my 
previous two labours, and my doula thought it was totally fantastic”
</h5>

					 <h5><b>09/02/2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Jessica Adam &nbsp;&nbsp; Auckland, New Zealand</b></h5>
                     <h5>I just wanted to say a huge thank you for a marvelous product and the opportunity I had to try it.<br>
All the midwives I say during my labour where puzzled by Laborelief and 
really looking dubious when I explained to them what it was but I had to
 have it for every single one of my contractions. If I didn't have it I 
was shooting to my husband and he would come running with it. I mean it 
really helped me to focus on getting through each of the pains and it 
particularly helped me in the pushing stage. When I was biting down I 
has less likely to waste all of my energy on making noise and all of my 
energy went to pushing which was great. By the end the midwives where 
actually extremely impressed by the product so I would definitely 
recommend it to anyone.
<br>And I would really just like to say a big thank you again for the opportunity to try it.

					 <h5><b>27/02/2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Kristin D Claire &nbsp;&nbsp; Queenstown, New Zealand</b></h5>
                     <h5>“It was fantastic for managing pain with contractions. I went the first 12 hours with no gas and air or pain relief.<br>
I was also told that I had a short pushing stage and that I pushed very well.<br>
I would highly recommend it and the midwives said it helped too.”
</h5>
                     <br>
					 <h5>22/02/2015 &nbsp;&nbsp; Heather Wealth &nbsp;&nbsp; Melbourne, Australia<b></b></h5>
                     <h5>“So I woke on a Monday morning with a start of 
the short and not too painful contractions and I knew the birth was 
going to happen today. During the day, the contractions increased 
slightly but still hardly felt them<br>
in the afternoon my husband and I drove our eldest son to his 
grandparents so that when the time comes we can go straight to the 
hospital.<br>
We got home around 10pm, and immediately took the Laborelief I kept in 
my bedside table and put the first stage one in my mouth and I fell 
asleep.<br>
Around five o'clock I woke with pretty intense but bearable contractions and we left for the hospital. <br>
At 6am they received us at the hospital where my contractions already 
started to hurt, so I bit down on the Laborelief in my mouth with every 
contraction and felt immediate relieve.<br>
When the pain got worse I changed the Laborelief to the next level and I
 concentrated the tension and pain in the mouth area ... I cannot 
explain how I knew when the time to replace it was, I just knew! 
Moreover, I even took it out of my mouth between contractions and popped
 it right back again when they started like an instinct, and despite the
 terrible pain another contraction brought and the state of mind I was 
in, I knew when to put it back in.<br>
After an hour with the monitor and replacing two Laboreliefs the doctor 
said I was with five fingers dilated.  After about ten minutes of 
intensified pain the doctor came back and said “Honey, you are about to 
deliver your baby, as I did not have the Laborelief it my mouth at that 
moment and the pain was so intense I could see stars (I was without an 
epidural with both births) my husband popped it back in my mouth which 
almost instantly helped.<br>
I was then taken to the delivery room and the two midwives who were with
 me in told me that within two pushes the baby will be out.... And it 
was!<br>
My Naomi was born on Tuesday at 7:50 after An hour and a half of painful
 labour, but  If I compare this to my previous birth which was  at least
  7 hours of  intolerable labour this birth was shorter and easier and I
 honestly believe the Laborelief has a lot to do with it.<br>
The Laborelief sat comfortably in my mouth (hell, I fell asleep with 
it!) and I really did not notice it, whole thing of putting it in and 
changing just felt natural and I’m extremely grateful for that”<br>

					 <h5><b>07/12/2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; Lilly Brown &nbsp;&nbsp; LA, California, USA</b></h5>
                     <h5>"I used Laborelief for the pushing stage and it
 helped me pop out my daughter out in 20 minutes, only after I told my 
friends how long it took I realised how super quick it was. I would 
recommend Laborelief to anyone that wants a less painful natural birth. 
Thank you Laborelief"</h5>

					 <h5><b>21/10/2014 &nbsp;&nbsp; Emma Emily &nbsp;&nbsp; via Facebook</b></h5>
                     <h5>“I found Laborelief fantastic, I found it made 
me feel calmer, and it was extremely helpful when it came to pushing 
because I was able to focus all my energy in the right direction with 
its help, and it took away the tension from my jaw and face.

<br>The midwives could not believe how helpful it was!”
